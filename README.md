# PROJECT ARCHIVED

Facebook has made it impossible for this application to work for new users, and I suspect it won't take long until
it stops working for existing users as well. I've lost interest in playing this cat and mouse game where I spend lots
of time trying to figure out yet another way to access user's events on Facebook just for Facebook to randomly change
the code or the URL again (I know they don't do it because of this app, they have their working app so they don't have
to care about changing they site as they need).

Thus, this repository is archived, and the app has been unpublished from Google Play.

It was my first Android app and although keeping up with Facebook changes was tough, it was overall fun and a great
learning experience!

I want to thank everyone who opened issues, created pull requests and submitted translations for the app. Thank you very much!

# Event Sync for Facebook

Sync your Facebook Events into your Android calendar.

Event Sync for Facebook is a free open-source app that will sync your Facebook events to your Android calendar. It will create five new calendars:

* Events I'm Attending - for events that you marked yourself that you are 'Going' on Facebook
* Events I May Be Attending - for events that you marked yourself as 'Maybe' on Facebook
* Events I Have Not Responded To - for events that you were invited to but did not respond yet
* Events I Declined - for events that you marked yourself as 'Not Going' on Facebook
* Friends' Birthdays - you no longer have an excuse to forget your friends' birthdays

You can configure reminders for events in each of those calendars independently. You can also configure how often the events should be synced.
